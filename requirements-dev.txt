# Nutflix Platform - Development vs Production Requirements

## Development (Codespaces/Local)
```bash
# For development without Pi hardware
pip install flask flask-cors opencv-python numpy tensorflow python-dotenv pyyaml aiofiles
```

## Production (Raspberry Pi)  
```bash
# Full installation on Pi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Differences:
- **Dev**: Uses tensorflow (large but full featured)
- **Pi**: Uses tflite-runtime (optimized for Pi)
- **Dev**: Skips hardware packages (adafruit, picamera2)
- **Pi**: Includes all hardware support
