# Project Assets - Missing Files Documentation

## Missing Image Assets

The following image files are referenced in the code but missing from the repository:

### Modal Background Images (referenced in Modal.jsx)
- `bark-spring.jpg` - Spring seasonal background
- `bark-summer.jpg` - Summer seasonal background  
- `bark-fall.jpg` - Fall seasonal background
- `bark-winter.jpg` - Winter seasonal background

## Current Status
The Modal component has been updated to use CSS gradients as fallback backgrounds when these images are missing.

## Professional Solution Options

### Option 1: Remove Seasonal Images (Recommended)
- Remove all references to seasonal bark images
- Use consistent CSS gradient backgrounds
- Simplify the modal design

### Option 2: Add Placeholder Images
- Create simple, professional bark texture images
- Ensure all required assets are in repository
- Maintain seasonal theming

### Option 3: Make Images Optional
- Add proper error handling for missing images
- Graceful fallback to CSS backgrounds
- Better user experience

## Repository Completeness
A professional repository should include ALL assets needed to run the application. Missing assets create deployment issues and poor user experience.
