Nutflix Backend Prep Checklist
API Endpoints:
You already have /api/research/sightings and /api/research/trends returning JSON. ✔️

CORS Enabled:
Flask-CORS is installed and enabled, so React can fetch from Flask. ✔️

Flask Running:
Make sure your Flask app is running (usually on port 8000).
You can start it with:

python dashboard/app.py
Database Exists:
Your nutflix.db should exist and have the clip_metadata and environment_readings tables with some data.
If you’re not sure, I can help you check or create them.

Open Ports:
If you’re using Codespaces or a remote dev environment, make sure both ports (Flask: 8000, React: 3000) are open and accessible.

No Path Conflicts:
Cloning the React repo into your workspace won’t overwrite any existing files, since it will go into its own folder (e.g., codespaces-react/).
